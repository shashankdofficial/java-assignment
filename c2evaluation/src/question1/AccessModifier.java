public class AccessModifier {

	//Access Modifier allow us to access of a scope or field, methods, constructor , or even class so we can change the level of access
	//of the fields, constructor, methods, class using the access modifier on it.
	
	//There are 4 Access Modifier in JAVA
	//1. Private : This can be access only within the class.
	//2. Default : This can be access within the package only.
	//3. Protected : This can be access within or outside the package but, for outside we have to make Child Class.
	//4. Public : It can be access everywhere within the package or outside the package or within class and outside the class.
	
	
	//Is-A Relationship

	//An IS-A relationship is inheritance,the classes which inherit are known as sub classes or child
	//classes.In this we can say that child class is a type of parent class.
	//for eg-an cat is a Animal,so you will extend Animal to get Cat class.

//	class Cat extends Animal{
//		
//	}

	//It is a static(compile time)binding

	//Has-A Relationship

	//An Has-A Relationship is composition means creating instances which have references to other objects.
	//for eg- a room has a table,so you will create a class room and then in that class create an instance of
	//type table.

//	class Room{
//	 Table table=new Table();
//	}
	
	
	//It is dynamic(runtime binding
}
